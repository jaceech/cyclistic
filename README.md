# Converting Casual Riders to Annual Members 


### Scenario
We are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

### Business Task
The goal of this case study is to provide clear insights for designing marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. Towards this goal, I asked the following questions:

How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?

How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?


### Data Preperation
This case study uses Cyclistic's historical trip data (previous 12 months) to analyze and identify trends. The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under and open license. The data can be dowloaded [here.](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html)

This data is reliable, original, comprehensive and current as it is internally collected and stored safely by Cyclistic from January 2022 to December 2022. Personally identifiable information  such as credit card numbers has been removed because of data-privacy issues.

The data selected for use covers the last 12 months. Each month has a separate dataset. The datasets are organized in tabular format and have 13 identical columns. Combined, the datasets have 4073561 uncleaned rows. The **member_casual** column will allow me to group, aggregate and compare trends between casual riders and member riders. 

### Cleaning the data 
The tools I used to clean and process the data were Excel and BigQuery. If I were to do this project again I would opt out of using excel and go straight into BigQuary, reason being A worksheet can only have 1,048,576 rows in Microsoft Excel because of its inability to manage large amounts of data. Because the Cyclistic dataset has more than 5.6 million rows, it is essential to use a platform like BigQuery that supports huge volumes of data. Never the less I opted into using power query in excel and combined all 12 sheets into a singular sheet. I then filtered out rows that returned null or 0 values on all columns of the spreadsheet. after I loaded the powerquery into a new excel sheet and titled it 2022Bikedata.csv.

Using Bigquery I loaded in my 2022Bikedata.csv to create new insights from my dataset
